# GAN Network Project

## What is a GAN Network?

A **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** is a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, the **Generator** and the **Discriminator**, which are trained simultaneously through adversarial processes.

- **Generator**: This network generates new data instances that resemble the training data.
- **Discriminator**: This network evaluates the data instances and tries to distinguish between real data (from the training set) and fake data (created by the generator).

The goal of the generator is to produce data so realistic that the discriminator cannot tell it apart from real data, while the discriminator aims to get better at distinguishing real from fake data. This adversarial process continues until the generator produces highly realistic data.

## Project Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a GAN network for [insert your specific application, e.g., generating realistic images, creating art, etc.]. The code is written in [insert programming language, e.g., Python] using [insert libraries/frameworks, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch].

## Demo

Below is a GIF demonstrating the training process of the GAN network:

*This GIF shows how the generator improves over time, producing more realistic images as training progresses.*
